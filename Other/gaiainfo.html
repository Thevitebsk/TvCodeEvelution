<p id="NOTE">this page is an excuse for me to show my fictional planet, also thank my IT Step Collage proffesor for formating this a bit</small>
<h1>Gaia, the litteral second Earth</h1>
<h1 id="question"><i>What is Gaia?</i></h1>
<p>Gaia is a slightly scientifically unstable planet caused by two stars
(with the names <i>"Gaiagoform Type Core"</i> and <i>"Gaiagoform Type Reactor"</i> after they were discoverd by scientist's several decades after)
coliding with each other, which should've been impossible according to the science rules<br>
No one knows sure for what managed to cause that reaction, even to this day</p>
<h1 id="question"><i>Is there any known history of the planet?</i></h1>
<p>Yes, there is actual history of that planet taken from the scientist's at the Gaian International Labratory<br>
The timeline of events goes like this:</p>
<table id="hist">
    <thead><tr><th scope="col">Time period</th><th scope="col">Events that happend during it</th></tr></thead>
    <tbody><tr>
        <th scope="row">200000 B.C.</th>
    </tr></tbody>
</table>
