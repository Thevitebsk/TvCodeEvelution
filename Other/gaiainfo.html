<p id="NOTE">this page is an excuse for me to show my fictional planet, also thank my IT Step Collage proffesor for formating this a bit</small>
<h1>Gaia, the litteral second Earth</h1>
<h1 id="question"><i>What is Gaia?</i></h1>
<p>Gaia is a slightly scientifically unstable planet caused by two stars
(with the names <i>"Gaiagoform Type Core"</i> and <i>"Gaiagoform Type Reactor"</i> after they were discoverd by scientist's several decades after)
coliding with each other, which should've been impossible according to the science rules<br>
No one knows sure for what managed to cause that reaction, even to this day</p>
<h1 id="question"><i>Is there any known history of the planet?</i></h1>
<p>The full pitcture hasn't been set yet, so be patient untill the history get's unfollded enough.
<br><big><big><big><i>but we still have some of the history:</i></big></big></big><br></p>
<p id="fyoucss">200000 B.C.: The explosion of the two stars would make a Earthquake-like disasster for about 2 hours before heating everyplanet by 15°C<br>
The planet's tempature whould cool down after 10 years</p>
<p id="fyoucss">Late 1969: Before our Apollo 11 was invented, the crew decided to explore fistly Gaia and then the moon<br>
The Apollo 11 in this universe would be made about like 4 months later (due to the fact they needed safely land in the Earth-like planet)<br>
After landing to the Gaia planet, they would meet people somewhat similar to their civlization, thinking that it's some kind of doppelgänger planet<br>
The Gaian people who saw the landing, they reashured them that they're not doppelgängers of their planet (considering it has some minor changes to the political map)<br>
They also decided to give them a tour of the town they landed to for about a day<br>
Eventually the crew rememberd about the mission to get to the moon with a new rocked called "CAEM" or "Continuation of the Apollo Eleven Mission"</p>
